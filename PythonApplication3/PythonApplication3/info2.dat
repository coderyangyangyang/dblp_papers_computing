{"abstract": "In this paper, an effective artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is proposed to solve the multi-objective flexible job-shop scheduling problem with the criteria to minimize the maximum completion time, the total workload of machines and the workload of the critical machine simultaneously. By using the effective decoding scheme, hybrid initialization strategy, crossover and mutation operators for machine assignment and operation sequence, local search based on critical path and population updating strategy, the exploration and exploitation abilities of ABC algorithm are stressed and well balanced. Simulation results based on some widely used benchmark instances and comparisons with some existing algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ABC algorithm.", "authors": ["Gang Zhou", "Ling Wang", "Ye Xu", "Shengyao Wang"], "references": ["02518715-41b3-4c3e-925f-ba8364ed51f3", "4f204788-626b-4d42-9bca-5d2d292798d9", "8fc670fb-32ec-49ba-b289-8543c6ef4182", "9da22606-9754-4f19-bc87-ca6d8d51655d", "a0c20b6d-7c76-4075-8b0b-a470cca96f6f", "d15e5f25-dbcb-4d6a-9ad4-d1792c8e3317", "d748d820-703c-48a4-b1ca-bc1c05b412ae", "edf996fd-115a-49af-9ff7-2050e5c43035"], "title": "An effective artificial bee colony algorithm for multi-objective flexible job-shop scheduling problem", "venue": "international conference on intelligent computing", "year": 2011, "id": "404af029-7b83-48fd-8be4-0dd6ecfa09ce"}

{"abstract": "In the paper it is shown how the known results of stability theory can be simply applied to stability investigation of equilibrium points of some systems of nonlinear difference equations with stochastic perturbations. A system of two difference equations with exponential nonlinearity is considered and it is shown that instead of the zero equilibrium this system can have also a positive equilibrium. Sufficient conditions for stability in probability of the both equilibriums of the initial nonlinear system with stochastic perturbations are obtained. Numerical simulations and figures illustrate a convergence of the positive solutions of the considered system to one of two (zero or positive) equilibriums in deterministic and stochastic cases. The proposed investigation procedure can be applied for arbitrary nonlinear equations with an order of nonlinearity higher than one.", "authors": ["Leonid Shaikhet"], "references": ["7ebb1ec2-75f0-40f7-87f4-df6a8d18fbed", "e611441f-b0d8-4eb1-8f0c-b24e034c7300"], "title": "Stability of equilibrium states for a stochastically perturbed exponential type system of difference equations", "venue": "Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics", "year": 2015, "id": "405d7a71-f8ac-4165-bac8-4b018740f90f"}

{"abstract": "During tumorigenesis, genetic aberrations arise and may deeply affect the tumoral cell physiology. It has been partially demonstrated that an increase of genes copy numbers induces higher expression; but this effect is less clear for small genetic modifications. To study it, we propose a systems biology approach that en- ables the integration of CGH and expression data together with an influence graph derived from biological knowledge. This work is based on 3 key ideas. 1) Inter- individual variations in gene copy number and in expression allow to attack tumor varability and ultimately adresses the problem of individual-centered therapeutics. 2) Confronting post-genomic data to known regulations is a good way to check the soundness and limits of current knowledge. 3) The abstraction level of qualitative modeling allows integration of heterogeneous data sources. We tested this approach on Ewing tumor data. It allowed the definition of new biological hypotheses that were assessed by random permutation of the initial data sets.", "authors": ["Sylvain Blachon", "Gautier Stoll", "Carito Guziolowski", "Andrei Zinovyev", "Emmanuel Barillot", "Anne Siegel", "Ovidiu Radulescu"], "references": ["11237f9d-6bd6-4a49-bb95-3ef2cd5556b5", "b7f7345a-6a56-42c4-a093-d5525a26d0fb", "ca10480c-9653-4ec0-8691-23ea6d89a1ea"], "title": "Method for Relating Inter-patient Gene Copy Numbers Variations with Gene Expression via Gene Influence Networks", "venue": "", "year": 2009, "id": "40621bcc-9b8a-4f7f-bcf9-95119aae87df"}

We propose a unifying framework for subgradient methods which yields two kinds of methods, namely, the proximal gradient method (PGM) and the conditional gradient method (CGM), unifying several existing methods. The unifying framework provides tools to analyze the convergence of PGMs and CGMs for non-smooth, (weakly) smooth, and further for structured problems such as the inexact oracle models. The proposed subgradient methods yield optimal PGMs for several classes of problems and yield optimal and nearly optimal CGMs for smooth and weakly smooth problems, respectively.", "authors": ["Masaru Ito"], "references": ["108837cb-0471-42c1-91d2-0b447ff47256", "109367fa-db04-4db0-8777-d6ca7e9e78fd", "14f5048e-d6ef-4f72-aa8a-9731386e688a", "1ddd1cc5-b31f-409e-b240-299e12ea766a", "2d5e8c4c-8421-4d8b-b07e-0ffc7a60f544", "33af1648-b045-4a0e-a8b9-969782a53d88", "3b2a5324-7b66-4101-9982-3a26e82afa3d", "4496531f-51fa-4f53-ae37-ca0d69d30b2e", "489b5715-2976-4a07-8eb7-fee0e4d9e301", "4cda8962-8e13-4d48-b8ad-d3243bdd0bc3", "5838128c-c31d-44c0-bd6d-12071e3c4561", "615f9cb5-c859-4fb1-919d-d7d0166e4f1e", "6681b82a-df1f-44cc-a119-17c6d481f487", "76337452-c70b-40da-94ab-ac1c799b8d7b", "8134e096-0a8b-4dd5-acd8-9e531678555a", "95b990d4-afa1-4adf-affa-5693416b18dd", "9f6a173f-b2a2-4633-8be6-4fe796149c27", "a56ac2bb-24fd-4fcd-b103-4997326b4564", "b6a80409-0fec-4799-ad9c-ec09109b0e7e", "cad931ed-1788-4a7e-add2-914a149d2973", "da3a0730-921b-453c-9f75-02547b1e388d", "f0c0249b-4cef-436c-904f-1d70ef15d300", "f4ad2799-0e40-4736-b201-7796589d84b9", "f75ce32a-7c42-4fd6-b043-e45ef3697bb3"], "title": "New results on subgradient methods for strongly convex optimization problems with a unified analysis", "venue": "Computational Optimization and Applications", "year": 2016, "id": "40691bce-cc67-4bff-879e-dad208b003ba"}
{"abstract": "Complex events consist of various human interactions with different objects in diverse environments. The evidences needed to rec- ognize events may occur in short time periods with variable lengths and can happen anywhere in a video. This fact prevents conventional machine learning algorithms from effectively recognizing the events. In this pa- per, we propose a novel method that can automatically identify the key evidences in videos for detecting complex events. Both static instances (objects) and dynamic instances (actions) are considered by sampling frames and temporal segments respectively. To compare the character- istic power of heterogeneous instances, we embed static and dynamic instances into a multiple instance learning framework via instance simi- larity measures, and cast the problem as an Evidence Selective Ranking (ESR) process. We impose \ufffd 1 norm to select key evidences while us- ing the Infinite Push Loss Function to enforce positive videos to have higher detection scores than negative videos. The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is used to solve the optimiza- tion problem. Experiments on large-scale video datasets show that our method can improve the detection accuracy while providing the unique capability in discovering key evidences of each complex event.", "authors": ["Kuan-Ting Lai", "Dong Liu", "Ming-Syan Chen", "Shih-Fu Chang"], "references": ["08990e11-26ca-46c5-ae10-1f55499d641b", "13f327e0-8f78-4567-8dcd-70da0ff31f51", "161c96a7-6dd3-4d9f-bc40-e06c21d9b6d8", "22ab89ae-a471-409f-ba0a-796d6e6c07c0", "250b1d38-e61d-4108-8d01-09e2befbe9bc", "307db816-5b31-4902-b554-29597320719d", "578c1183-250e-4b6d-9b69-481cf5a77662", "5da724e4-e228-4e10-86d0-1183365c21f6", "6765f61a-6752-4d6b-8eec-de87796b53cb", "74bbd15b-f852-4920-a89a-7569248cebb9", "7651ba41-d7a3-4de7-b826-ce668867f90a", "8f0767d2-ca4d-4837-b9a8-c2db5f069703", "98be2848-7564-4287-aa08-e0780dac6d3d", "9aaf99e2-1d46-4068-a4da-475482887108", "9bc118e9-7213-4a4b-bc91-8c98656299c2", "a246e432-612a-4481-95b5-29ba3db6369b", "aafae996-7d9d-44e1-be0c-323ad997a3fe", "b4ccce1a-36a5-4683-ad4b-40dbbbc721fb", "b911c1ab-7181-44e9-85df-c8505ba5e54e", "b944f77f-113b-4a02-ae5e-d4a124b8fd5b", "c20b4d9d-ef1d-4985-91c4-f25bf418e6a6", "c87c959d-5a15-42cd-9fba-e1929d9bbaa6", "c9d99dab-b4b6-4c05-931b-9ebb4e3b812a", "cbb90d37-46ad-4561-af57-6c8d29b14013", "d17f7d9e-f650-442f-9759-6e8153098f2f"], "title": "Recognizing Complex Events in Videos by Learning Key Static-Dynamic Evidences", "venue": "european conference on computer vision", "year": 2014, "id": "406a2ad2-5ff5-4206-8079-05c2e4a91c41"}

{"abstract": "In this paper, we present our designed prototype: CollaborGeneous. CollaborGeneous is a framework of collaborative IT-tools for heterogeneous groups of learners in Civic Orientation. It is designed to serve different types of activities for producing, maintaining, distributing and presenting digital learning-material within Civic Orientation. The significance of introducing our prototype is relevant for both practitioners and researchers within Design Science Research. The novelty of our artifact lies in its characteristic of use in the intersection between Civic Orientation and Information Systems, providing different groups of learner's necessary tools to collaborate and create an open digital experience of Civic Orientation.", "authors": ["Amir Haj-Bolouri", "Lennarth Bernhardsson", "Patrik Bernhardsson"], "references": ["885cfaf9-43e5-4101-9554-40962d09fe53", "96eea085-4929-4577-8fce-b95af567755c"], "title": "CollaborGeneous: A Framework of Collaborative IT-Tools for Heterogeneous Groups of Learners", "venue": "", "year": 2015, "id": "407d8b95-de8c-42a8-ab8d-c3f7a62cf7d8"}
{"abstract": "HTCondor is a distributed job scheduler developed by the University of Wisconsin-Madison, which allows users to run their applications in other users' machines when they are not being used, thus providing a considerably increase in the overall computational power and a more efficient use of the computing resources. Our institution has been successfully using HTCondor for more than ten years, and HTCondor is nowadays the most used Supercomputing resource we have. Although HTCondor provides a wide range of tools and options for its management and administration, there are currently no tools that can show detailed usage information and statistics in a clear, easy to interpret, interactive set of graphics displays. For this reason, we have developed ConGUSTo, a web-based tool that allows to collect HTCondor usage and statistics data in an easy way, and present them using a variety of tabular and graphics charts.", "authors": ["Antonio J.
